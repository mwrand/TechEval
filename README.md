# TechEval

This was definitely an interesting way to test candidates.  :-)

On the surface very gentle.  Take your time, and go build something on your system.  Unfortunately, I 
don't have a personal set up. Since I'm unemployed right now--no work computer--I had to learn 
about developing on a Mac.  Failed at getting VS Code to do all I needed, but then I learned about 
Jet Brains Rider.  Also because I was on a Mac there was a real question about what DB to use.  Started 
with SQLite, and installed RazorLite as my UI.  It worked great, but I didn't know what issues that 
would cause for you guys, so while poking around online I was reminded of Microsoft's InMemoryDB for 
just this stype of situation, and since EntityFramework has an InMemory provider it was super easy to 
wire up.

After setting everything up, the only other issue is where is the finish line!?  I think I have made a nice 
little console app, and I've done enough things around error handling, having descrete methods, have a couple of 
clear models, put the JSON Url value in the appsettings.json file, etc that its a decent show of how I look at 
problems.  But I've done no unit testing, and even though I could of, I did not create any extra classes or demostrate any 
real dependencty injection.  

And if we meet to discuss, I do have a least one question about the specs that I'm not sure if I covered. But yeah, with the 
feeling that there is always more that we can do, and there is always more to learn... here's my code!  :-)
